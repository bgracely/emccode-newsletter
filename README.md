###Archive of the weekly EMC {code} Newsletter###

This repo is a little bit silly, but the service we use to publish our weekly newsletter decided to abandon their archiving service, so we're just going to post all the newsletter links here. 

If anyone would like to sign up for the weekly newsletter, [here is the signup link](http://bit.ly/emccodesignup). It's free and comes out every Tuesday. We won't use your email address for any promotional materials or marketing lists.
